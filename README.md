## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
- Purpose of this project was to vizualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Wanted to help the volunteers identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This was to help Improbable Beef identify a species that could potentially be a candidate to help Improbable Beef manufacture synthetic beef.
